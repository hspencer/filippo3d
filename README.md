# DrawLander

A 3D drawing program built on [Processing](http://www.processing.org) and based on [Fillipo 3D](https://github.com/hspencer/filippo3d)

## Keyboard
###VIEWS
 *  (F)ront
 *  (T)op
 *  (L)eft
 *  (R)ight
 *  (B)ottom
 *  bac(K)
 *  SPACEBAR or MOUSE RIGHT BUTTON switches to free rotation mode
 
### MODEL TRANSLATION<br>(relative to mouseX and screen X dimension)
 *  (1) While pressed, translates the drawinng in X
 *  (2) While pressed, translates the drawinng in Y
 *  (3) While pressed, translates the drawinng in Z
 
### MODEL SCALATION<br>(relative to mouseX and screen X dimension)
 *  (4) While pressed, scales the drawinng in X
 *  (5) While pressed, scales the drawinng in Y
 *  (6) While pressed, scales the drawinng in Z
 
### MODEL ROTATION
 *  (X) increases the rotation angle in X
 *  (x) decreases the rotation angle in X
 *  (Y) increases the rotation angle in Y
 *  (y) decreases the rotation angle in Y
 *  (Z) increases the rotation angle in Z
 *  (z) decreases the rotation angle in Z
 
### EXPORT
 *  (p) exports a PDF of the current view
 *  (P) exports a series of 36 PDFs rotating in Y
 *  (d) exports a DXF of the 3D model
 
###  OTHER
 *  (A)xis turn ON/OFF
 *  (e)rase the selected stroke
 *  (u)ndo
 *  (m) changes current mode, draw or select
 *  (s) Select Everything
 *  (w) unselect everything
 *  (N) new drawing (erases everything and resets view)
 *  (,) reduce stroke size
 *  (.) increase stroke size
